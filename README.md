This repository contains supplementary materials for the my article titled ["Four Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming: Building Strong Foundations"](https://towardsdev.com/four-pillars-of-object-oriented-programming-building-strong-foundations-5d3970f70733), published on [Towards Dev](https://towardsdev.com/).

## Article Overview

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental paradigm in software development, offering powerful tools for organizing and structuring code. The article explores the four core principles of OOP:

1. **Encapsulation**
2. **Abstraction**
3. **Inheritance**
4. **Polymorphism**

Each pillar is discussed in detail, emphasizing its significance in creating robust, scalable, and maintainable software systems. Practical examples are provided to illustrate how these principles are applied in real-world scenarios.

## Repository Contents

This repository serves as a companion to the article, providing code examples and additional resources related to each pillar of OOP:

- **Encapsulation**: Demonstrates how to encapsulate data within objects and control access to it, enhancing data security and code maintainability.
- **Abstraction**: Illustrates the concept of abstraction by creating abstract classes and interfaces, allowing developers to define common behavior without specifying implementation details.
- **Inheritance**: Explores inheritance as a mechanism for creating a hierarchy of classes, enabling code reuse and promoting a modular design approach.
- **Polymorphism**: Showcases polymorphic behavior, where objects of different types can be treated interchangeably, promoting flexibility and extensibility in code.

## Usage
